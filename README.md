# Deep-learning-with-both-NLP-and-non-NLP-features

Merge Nlp features(the documents) and Non-nlp features(real features, columns in the dataset) into single neural network and predict for question pair similarity (3 different inputs) 

Yields much higher test accuracy than single nlp features/non-nlp features
